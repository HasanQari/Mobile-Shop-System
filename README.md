Mobile Shop System


Project Idea :
We have strived to try to create an application that meets the requirements that it
needs, so the seller was an integrated system that requires registration and login to it.
so, the seller can:
• Add products and inspect it
• View and Manage the Orders
• Create new local requests
• Monitor the statistics of the store
• Check inventory of the Store
• Register in the system and login and view password if forget.
this was what related to the seller’s side, but from the buyer’s side he had A home
page through which he can
• View the products that the store provides
• Add items to the shopping cart
• Can view the shopping cart
• Modifying the products in the cart
• Can continue to pay by cash, PayPal or credit card
to obtain the order number with which he can receive His Orders
